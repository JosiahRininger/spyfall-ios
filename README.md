# Spyfall

#### Note: under refactor while learning every day about better iOS practices. Such as not putting everything in one view model. My bad.

This is a currently under construciton iOS application named Spyfall (after the classic game). It is a multiplayer game in which one person is assigned to be a spy while 
all other players are assigned a role at a location. The spy's objective is to figure out the location through a series of well worded questions while not giving
away that he or she is the spy. Meanwhile, everyone else's objective is to figure out the spy. All players take turns asking questions. 

This project will not run properly as I have not included the back end connection publicly.
