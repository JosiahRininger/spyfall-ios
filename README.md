# Spyfall

This is a currently under construciton iOS application named Spyfall (after the classic game). It is a multiplayer game in which one person is assigned to be a spy while 
all other players are assigned a role at a location. The spy's objective is to figure out the location through a series of well worded questions while not giving
away that he or she is the spy. Meanwhile, everyone else's objective is to figure out who the spy is. All players take turns asking questions. 

This project will not run properly as I have not included the back end connection publicly. 

## Tech Stack
Xcode, Swift, Firebase, Lottie

# Spyfall

#### Note: under refactor  while learning every day about better Android practices. Such as not putting everything in one view model. My bad.
